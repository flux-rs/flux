<!-- Types bring order to code.

For example, if a variable `i:usize` then we know `i`
is a number that can be used to index a vector.
Similarly, if `v: Vec<&str>` then we can be sure that
`v` is a collection of strings which may _be_ indexed
but of course, not used _as_ an index.

However, by itself, `usize` doesn't tell us how big
or small the number and hence the programmer must
still rely on their own wits, a lot of tests, and
a dash of optimism, to ensure that all the different
bits snap together correctly at run-time. -->


Flux is a **refinement type checker** plugin for Rust
that lets you *specify* a range of correctness properties
and have them be *verified* at compile time.
Flux works by extending Rust's types with
[refinements][jhala-vazou] which are logical
assertions describing additional correctness
requirements that are then checked during compilation,
to eliminate various classes of run-time problems.

You can try it on the [**flux playground**](https://flux.goto.ucsd.edu/).

Better still, see the the [**online tutorial**](./01-refinements.md), to learn how you
can use Flux on your Rust code.
