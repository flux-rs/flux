//    as of the date such litigation is filed.

// 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
//    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
//    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

//        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
//        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
//        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
//        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
//        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
//        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
//        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

// 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
//    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
//    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
//    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
//    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
//    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
//    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

// 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
//    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
//    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
//    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

//    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
//    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
//    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
//    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

//    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
//    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
//    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

// 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
//    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
//    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
//    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
//    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
//    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
//    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
//    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
//    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
//    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
