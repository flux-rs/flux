Flux is a **refinement type checker** for Rust that lets you *specify*
a range of correctness properties and have them be *verified* at compile
time.

See the **examples**  -- listed in the summary on the left -- to learn about Refinement types and Rust.

You can try it online [here](https://flux.programming.systems).
