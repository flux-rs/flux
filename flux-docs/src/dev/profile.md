# Profiling Flux

Set `LR_DUMP_TIMINGS=true` to have flux write timing diagnostics to `./log/timings`.

Right now this is _extremely_ simple, it just provides some details for the spans under `flux_typeck` and `flux_driver`.

## Sample output

Below is a sample output for an invocation of `cargo-flux check` that took 19 seconds. The missing 2 seconds approximately accounts for the time it takes for `cargo check` to run.

Note that `check_crate` contains everything running under `check_top`, which is why the sum of the spans is greater than 19 seconds.
